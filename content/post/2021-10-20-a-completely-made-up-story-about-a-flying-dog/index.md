# Booker Prize contestant

Once upon a time, there was a little dog with a big dream. It would watch the birds fly and dream of flapping his ears and flying among them. He was a curious dog so naturally he wanted to go next to them and speak to them in order to understand why they fly in a V-shaped formation. The mischievous dog came up with a plan to steal the balloons from its owner's birthday party. He spun around and with the help of the friendly neighborhood cat, the dog managed to entangle himself in 6 balloons and he slowly started gaining altitude. Finally, his dream came true. All the dogs cheered him.  The higher he was, the more impressed he was from the view. His dream eventually came true - he was next to the birds. He started speaking to them, however, they quickly ran away. His plan was ingenious! Albeit, one fact was overlooked. Birds do not understand the language of barking! Ah, dogs will be dogs.
